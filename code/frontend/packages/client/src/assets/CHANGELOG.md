### BREAKING CHANGES

* not all pacakges have been updated. you need update: `node_modules\@angular-material-components\datetime-picker\lib\datetime-picker.component.d.ts`:
* remove CanColorCtr from import
* Set _MatDatepickerContentMixinBase to just be `typeof MatDatepickerContentBase`
* import missing attributes in `NgxMatDatetimeContent`
* **server:** All should be working as before, but if you want events combined, you can't paginate as you could before
* - DB was massivly reworked, you can try to migrate it, but in next commit a new import is going to be provided
